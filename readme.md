## Timer app in vanilla javascript

[Here's](http://sethborden.github.io/timer/timer.html#10) a live demo.

This thing is pretty much self documenting.

Defaults to a 20 minute timer, double-click the time to change.

Alternately, and assuming you have python 2.x installed, run `python
py2serve.py` from the command line and navigate to
`http://localhost:8000/timer.html#<time for timer in seconds>`, i.e. to get a 30
second timer go to `http://localhost:8000/timer.html#30`. If you're a python 3
purist run `py3serve.py`.
